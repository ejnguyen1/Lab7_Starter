1. The automated tests for the Recipe project should go within a Github action that runs whenever code is being pushed. This allows for automatically checking for bugs everytime changes are pushed. By testing incrementally, it's easier to debug along the way instead of running into bugs at the end of development. Github automated testing is also less error prone than manual testing.
